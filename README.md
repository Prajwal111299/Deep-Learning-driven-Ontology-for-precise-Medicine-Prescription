# Deep-Learning-driven-Ontology-for-precise-Medicine-Prescription

• Developed a Deep Learning-driven Ontology for Precise Medicine Prescription using TensorFlow and rdflib, integrating structured medical data from a CSV file to create an ontology and training a neural network model to predict medicines for given diseases. Demonstrated the system through a client demo video and facilitated code shipment via AnyDesk.

• The model Achieved an accuracy rate of 99%.
